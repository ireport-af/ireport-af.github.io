<h1>Help build an open global database to fight COVID-19</h1>
<p>
Currently, there is limited data coming directly from individuals in the community. Filling this survey can teach us about how COVID-19 is affecting people in real time, which can help inform the public and studies on the pandemic now and into the future. Responses will be publicly posted on the <a href="https://algorand.foundation">Algorand blockchain</a> to guarantee free and permanent access to anyone. Information you share cannot be changed or removed. Soon we will start publishing aggregate statistics from the reported data and will introduce tools for the community to build applications using the collected data.
</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://ireport-covid.app">fill out the survey</a> <b>even if you do not have symptoms</b> and update when changes happen.
